**`Chronically online..🌐👨🏻‍💻`**

I'm a passionate Front-End Developer building and learning new things every day. All coding projects are built with the desire to challenge myself and to create something better than what I created yesterday. If I'm not coding I'm probably making music, playing basketball, or queueing up for a League of Legends game.

<summary><h3>⛰️ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey as a lost and purposeless marketing graduate. I have always had a passion for creating which led me to pick up hobbies such as photography and music production in college. I had been producing music for 4 years at the time and decided to take a gap year after graduating to try to do music full time. After about 8 months, both the stress and my financial situation led to me getting burnt out and I was contemplating on finding a job in marketing. I then discovered coding from a Youtube video which recommended The Odin Project, which is a free open source curriculum teaching web development. I instantly fell in love with coding, and I spent all of my time learning to code. I replaced gaming youtube videos with coding videos and I even keep a journal to track my progress. I started learning to code on February 17 2023 and on June 9 2023 I landed my first Front-End Developer job. I mainly use NextJs & React, Tailwind CSS and Sass for styling, and Framer Motion for my animations. I am currently learning Back-End Development in my free time and plan to learn React Native in the future. I don't know what I will be doing in 5 years but I can say for certain that I will be coding. To whoever is reading this, I hope you have a great day and I hope we can create something great together :-)
